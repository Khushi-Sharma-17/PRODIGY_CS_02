# PRODIGY_CS_02
This Python program provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation. The encryption is done by applying a basic mathematical operation to the pixel values of the image, making the original image unrecognizable. The same operation is reversed to decrypt the image and restore it to its original form.
